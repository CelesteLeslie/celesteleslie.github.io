        <div class="subheading mb-5">Liberal Studies Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Celeste Leslie and I’m a 20 year old, part-time worker and college student. Currently, I am a third year Liberal Studies student at the University of California, Riverside. I graduated from Carter High School, with over a 3.5 gpa. I was a student athlete my whole life, so I had to work twice as hard to maintain a healthy balance.I played a variety of sports like ballet, gymnastics and basketball before landing on soccer for over six years. In the future, I hope to become either a teacher or service any career that allows me to help children. I feel that it’s important to look out for the new generations of students, since I did not have the best mentors/educators over the last few years. Many teachers give up at helping students or ignore personal issues, so I wish to be the teacher that I never had. I also have plans on traveling the world, learning more about the numerous of cultures and religions because or finding a teaching job somewhere in need.  
<br><br>

        Over the past few years, I have volunteered at multiple establishments that helped shaped who I am today. When it comes to volunteer work, I’ve often found myself motivated to helping children. During school hours, elementary through high school, I spent my time helping in the library or pulled out of class to help the younger students with reading and writing, so my volunteer work outside of school was very similar. I’ve helped at local libraries which included organizing, prepping new materials, and helping student find whatever they needed. This was very similar to the work I did when I helped at my own school library during 6th grade, but with more responsibility. I’ve also volunteered to help a teacher at another school clean out their class for the new year, as well as organize students paperwork. I believe these experiences are what helped me decided what I wanted to major in when entering college, since I found the most comfort in this.
<br><br>

        When it comes to professional work, I’ve worked a few jobs that have helped my customer service and allowed me to build a character, other than just a student. I have experience in fast food and retail stores; big and small companies. During my job at a fast food restaurant, I handled opening responsibilities, cash registers, talking with customers, and preparing food at a quick pace. This was a good first job that trained me to communicate and hold myself accountable. I was in highschool during this job, so I had to balance school, work, and two sport clubs. For retail, I’ve worked at two different companies and have experience in cash handling, customer service, organization, and closing responsibilities. Retail offered a very different environment in the way that it allowed me more freedom at a slower pace. Both of these jobs have taught the importance of being on time, responsibility and patience, which are key for my future career.
